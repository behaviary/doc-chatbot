### Background:
- Founder
- started call but we got cut off

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
	2. How long did you receive support?
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. parsing out emotions/reactions from the more clear steps that need to be taken.
	4. What did you wish was better?
		1. He thinks for the founder, so much is ambiguous and that is why they are trying to find frameworks or magic bullets since they are wading through a forest in every which way. Having more actionable frameworks from the coaching would be great to schedule or fit in to his work and growth path. 
		2. One of the reasons he was seeing the coach was because his co-founder and himself were having serious troubles. They had to fire the third co-founder. This relationship made things extreme and introduced a lot of noise to the day to day of making the company viable. He was searching for something to stand on, some framework or grounding or truth. I don't think I got that from my coach but I started to get pieces of it from my therapist. 
		3. At the time of being a y combinator founder, he had founding partners helping him with frameworks but did NOT find this to be true. YC founder community feels less safe when you are fighting with your co-founder and the YC folks have to invest their time wisely and may choose to focus it on the companies with less issues. 
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù, 
	1. Why haven‚Äôt you received coaching/therapy before?
	2. What would you need to be true to give it a try?
4. Do you know anyone who would be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach)?
	1. [ ] he'll think on referrals 
### Notes:
- no longer receiving coaching or therapy. He ended up doing some psychadelic therapy and was groundbreaking for him to gain some perspective. He's used the perspective to manage these types of things pretty well.

## 16-Oct-2023

- Executive coaching: during YC the batch director ended up starting coaching "how to maintain mental health while going through the ride of beginning a startup?" 
- He was the first cohort of Amy "the founders coach" in 2018. He would have looked for the "career coach" category, someone with a business background that could help navigate the professional and related emotional challenges. There are lists, or I would have posted to bookface. Looking for an executive coach, but they can be 10/20k retainer which is incredibly expensive. Instead of that, he would have preferred life coach/career coach that had a sense of startup requirements. 

- First few sessions in YC were free, then after YC she started charging more on the lines of therapy. Ultimately, Amy referred him to a therapist. 
- The thing he got from a person like Amy was that things can get muddled, and to stay focused on the day-to-day real requirements of a company, without letting emotions get in the way. WHILE also deal and grow through emotions. Amy worked to help him unpack work/emotion and then passed on to get specific help on emotional stuff. ## 23-Oct-2023

### Background:
- 

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. Yes
		1. therapy on and off since college. Executive coach chosen when starting Revel, proactively since they thought it would be helpful. Used them 6-9mo individually, ultimately decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it. This coach wasn‚Äôt providing the value they wanted, they needed a better fit. 
	2. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		1. Referred to her through her cofounder. They tried to work with another coach who was awesome, but he had a conflict of interest with another team of people building a similar product. 
		2. Tried two coaches, and went with the second. Had questions about if she would be a good fit when they started, but wanted to check this off their list quickly and made a less than optimal decision. 
	3. How long did you receive support?
		1. 6-9months 
	4. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. They thought it would be beneficial for the company, and they were friends before starting a company and didn‚Äôt want to mess up their friendship. They wanted to ensure they were working on themselves and their relationship as they grew the company.
		2. It made them more accountable to each other as founders. And did one or two sessions together as founders.
		3. They both know the areas they needed to improve and wanted to work on it with someone.
	5. What did you wish was better?
		1. Given that they selected someone that wasn‚Äôt perfect for them, having an idea of how to select someone that would be a good match would be great. 
		2. Just finding an executive coach is very difficult. People start by asking for a reference and often their friends don‚Äôt have any or good recommendations. 
		3. How to pay for it would be good to improve. Do you pay with cash, equity, VC money, etc.? 
			1. They used their business cash to pay for it. Later on, she paid with half cash half equity. 
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù, 
	1. Why haven‚Äôt you received coaching/therapy before?
	2. What would you need to be true to give it a try?
4. Would you be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach for yourself)?
### Notes:
-  Applying to jobs, Revel shut down after 4yrs
	- Downturn in the market accelerated it
- She would have used our service IF the quality of coach candidates was high enough. 
- Features she would like
	- I don‚Äôt necessarily know what I‚Äôd be looking for in terms of coaches. It would be nicer if based on what we know about her, we suggest to her what we think she needs.
	- How much you are willing to pay is a good filter
- She wants to beta test the onboarding once we have something ready. 
- [x] ask which coach she used AND the awesome one that had a conflict of interest, üìÖ 2023-10-20 ‚úÖ 2023-10-20

	1. business coach
	2. therapist
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		1. business coach wasn't a great fit because she didn't work with startups
			1. found her through the same church. Wasn't looking but it was opportunistic. After ending with her, she interviewed a few coaches with experience in tech
				1. right price is proportional to how much money/runway she has. No firm number in mind, between 500-5000/mo depends on funding
				2. right fit, what is really important to her who can speak to her identity as a founder, specifically as a black woman (she wants a woman of color of an underrepresented group).

### Notes:
- For therapy, wanted a black or latina therapist. Took her 6mo and dozens of therapists to find this AND in network. Some much of what causes me the most consternation is demographic.
- the intangible fit is hard to put into words, we know this within the first two min
- as a consumer she would definitely be interested in teh videos of coaches. She wouldn't want to make one of herself. 
- 10min onboarding sees reasonable. If the price is right and the service appeared to be of value she'd give it a go
	- what she means by valuable service, Come prepared with AN EXTREMELY SPECIFIC USE CASE "e.g. helped health tech startup get go to market plan with xyz details"
- MAX one update a month, add her to 

*************************************************************************************************************## [[24-Oct-2023]]
### Agenda:
- she wants to be a coach, talk about this
- what was the name of the coach she used?

	- hard skills and soft skills (presence, body language)
- Currently going through somatic training through "The Body Lab" (body related coaching)

	- She wants to start with $250/hr but possibly start lower
- when hearing the 20% commission, it sounds fine to her
	- what she cares about most right now is being matched with founders that she can make an impact on AND practice the skills she's learning. 
- she is currently open to more types of founders to get more experience since she is new

	2.  How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
			1. Finding a therapist, he is still considering changing his therapist. Most often therapist changed because of changes in his insurance plan. In grad school, was assigned a therapist but there was limitations of what they could do so found someone off campus. His therapist now is through betterhelp.

				2. He also used ‚Äútalkspace‚Äù in the past for offline therapy. 
					1. In addition to seeing a therapist in-person. Needed help while traveling outside of the US as his home is in Brazil.
			2. ABinBev previously had coaching they paid for but they stopped paying for it (BetterUp). Fully paid for and he could use it even a couple times per week. Too much to keep paying for himself

		1. He wanted support in better organizing himself and how to better navigate tough situations at work (stakeholder dynamics as he works in a large organization)
		2. It was nice to have someone to keep him accountable, hold him to routines and stay consistent.
		3. He was getting overwhelmed, and the coach helped him have clarity on what he should be doing and make hard decisions like how to say ‚Äúno‚Äù more often. 
	5. What did you wish was better?
		1. The matching process is a big pain point, at least for BetterHelp which he thought was supposed to be the most robust service out there, he was surprised how hard it was to find a good fit therapist.
			1. This was the biggest pain point
			2. He liked they offered a chat to help provide guidance outside of calls, he thinks this is the best type of service, hybrid chat/calls. His current coach is not good at the chat support (generic/not helpful). 
		2. He would ideally like to have a therapist in person and talk to via chat in between sessions, but adding in time to commute makes this tough. He now prefers virtual guidance to save him time. 
		3. He feels like his current approach is not ideal for him. She is good, but he wonders if there is someone out there that is better for him.
			1. He knows there are better APPROACHES that work for him.
		4. Matching based on shared values (e.g. religious preference) would be helpful. 
4. Would you be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach for yourself)?
	1. Keep him up-to-date
	2. He is actively looking to match with a new therapist

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
	1. No, I have received advice from mentors. In 2020 did some psychology sessions due to anxiety attack
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
	2. How long did you receive support?
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
	4. What did you wish was better?
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù, 
	1. Why haven‚Äôt you received coaching/therapy before?
		1. mostly because she hasn't had the need. Almost all of her friends are in the tech entrepreneurship world, an it is easy to have their support.
		2. I haven't gone to look
		3. first company got acquired this year. This company is with one of her closest friends. She has thought it through quite a bit before committing to work as co-founders
	2. What would you need to be true to give it a try?
		1. as a founder, "you should be talking to someone about the blockers and your feelings and all that". She already has this through her romantic partner who is also a founder. 
4. Do you know anyone who would be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach)?

### Notes:
- this is her second time going through TechStars, and they provide this community of sharing pain with 12 other people
- askMay is her tech
- once we launch let her know. 
- I should talk to people with a bigger pressure
- [x] She can introduce me to the Miami MD of techstars, send her a forwardable email üìÖ 2023-10-27 ‚úÖ 2023-10-27

	1. YES
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		2. It correlates to what my startup is, he helps people undergoing infertility treatment
			1. time consuming, awful experience
			2. His wife sourced the therapist, he went with her
	2. How long did you receive support?
		1. He did individual and couples sessions
		2. 1.5yrs 
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. having an outlet to talk through things to ensure it wasn't bottled up, that turn into compounding problems.
		2. talking through things allows you to deal/cope with it, and they provide you tools/resources to think about things in a different way/accept. 
	4. What did you wish was better?
		1. Scheduling of appointments (small clinic, independent provider), if you needed more immediate assistance she didn't have options (before pandemic/telehealth). Had to drive 30min one way
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù,

### Notes:
- people ask how he copes/deals with things as a founder. Nothing in the startup life is going to be as hard as the infertility treatment/early father. 
- He knew what he was looking for but thinks this is 
- his class is having a conversation around this specific thing
	- "mentor magic" where you speed date with mentors which is tough. talk to 30-70 mentors in a week (can save them a week), reach out to a program admin about this
		- if there were ways to speed that up that would be awesome
		- [x] email him what I'm looking for, he'll share with his class, üìÖ 2023-10-23 ‚úÖ 2023-10-24

### Notes:
- loved the humility of my outreach
- he has considered therapy since then, but haven't felt that the need has been acute enough to invest. He still has support inthe AA community
	- on executive coaching side, but he doesn't think his income/career trajectory warrants coaching
		- He's sure that it is expensive, and it has a reputational problem from loose accreditation. 
		- He's spoken with VP/C-suite folks who offhand mention they work with exec coaches which made his ears perk up. 
- $200-$500 price range makes sense to him
- he thinks it makes sense for later stages, maybe Series A
- FSA option is interesting, equity probably not an option. 
- he's going through Techstars, and they are good about founder mental health and wellbeing.

Talk therapy, did speak to an executive coach a year ago and she was offering private 1:1 AND group coaching. She was more interested in this with other female founders. ASk for contact. She did therapy for a year, stopped earlier this year. She had to interview multiple people on her own at first. Took her a long time to get over threshold to say "OKAY i'm actually going to do this and try therapy." 
- She reached out to friends in psychology and asked for their lists of recommendations. From that list she found someone she liked. 
- The friend didn't have to ask too many questions since she was a very close friend. 
	- Criteria: woman of color, someone who can understand south asian experience, she also didn't know if she needed a therapist vs executive coach. Wanted to talk about anxiety/stress of being a founder. 
	- Had a therapist that worked with other founders. Her friend did this for many of her friends in her circle and said "there is something here in terms of. She will intro me to her psychologist friend that wants this idea to win. 
	- 
NOTES: 
Her questions. do you have plans of incorporating behavior profile/generative AI to help with intake? YES. If we can scale the intake (have clients say things once, then use that over and over). "there's a lot of legs here". Schedule follow up call.  
  
## [[19-Oct-2023]] 
- She is in teh process of shutting down GlobalBelly  
- she graduated from her therapist, and really appreciated d her therapist saying she doesn't NEED it any more.  
- we have a strong application. Since we are pre-MVP, what will stand out is HOW WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THINGS? How aware are you of your strengths/weaknesses. They love things you can sell to other YC companies  
- number of startups that fail due to cofounder relationship issues "PUT THIS FRONT AND CENTER"  
- [x] Follow up with Madhuri, intro me to Natalie, üìÖ 2023-10-24 ‚úÖ 2023-10-24
	- exec coaching seminars for team building. Knows trends from enterprise point of view.  
- commercialization is a big issue for early founders who haven't launched a product before. Having someone on our board/advisors that have grown or sold something is very great.  
- Benefits of getting into YC or not, is getting great feedback. The process of prepping for interview/going through questions and poking holes in everything train us so well that we can go out and fundraise easier after .  
- getting feedback from YC/investors, they throw tech bro jargon into the email. It is helpful to learn this language and ask other founders what it means.

	1. YES
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		2. Have had three therapy experiences, two before being a foiunder
			1. one was for an eating disorder and was found through Kaiser, so she was assigned a team of professionals. This was a pretty good experience.
			2. In college, tried to find therapist to prevent relapse and it was difficult since LA has a shortage of therapists. First appt was 3mo out, and then they cancelled the appt. Then went through BetterHelp because of the ads, it was expensive for a college student, so she just did the messaging but felt she could do this through Omegle. 
			3. Since  being a founder, it was COVID and a few years out from college and big transition time, went through Kaiser and went through a matchmaking person who didn't seem to understand what I needed even though I said "I have crippling anxiety related to finding direction in life"
				1. it is a hassle to find someone new, so I didn't shop around for a therapist. Sometimes. 
	2. How long did you receive support?
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. She had a lot of time on her hands all of a sudden (in COVID and company wasn't in a super stressful stage), do I spend more time building a community or on my company. It helped me find out what my values are, and during COVID there was an anxiety of death/dying and losing family.

### Notes:
- techstars new york is given a coach for each team.
- there is a discord of Techstars alumni which includes perks
	- this coach was a perk, 
	- two tiers of perks 
		- techstars universe (software etc listed online)
		- other perks in discord. 
- he has a coaching certificate but didn't think he was ready to start coaching other people
- the founder has to want to be coachable and he doesn't think many founders are like this
- "I'd rather have a coach than no coach, even if the coach was subpar. We are all stuck in our own shit, and having outside perspective from someone with no skin in the game to bring us back up to the 10000ft perspective is valuable"
- "none of us are as far along as we think we are"
	- a lot of intellectual masturbation with things like "jobs to be done"
- How techstars is trying to structure the coaching element, you get paired with 3 other founders, they have stoplight system (red, green personally). I don't find this useful at all. They talk to a managing director + associates. MD is great, the associates are often 20yr old taking a semester off from undergrad. They have no life experience. 
- he feels mentor madness is a waste of time (or at least inefficient), 3 weeks of preparation and two weeks of interviewing mentors. He thinks the mentors need to be vetted better
- techstars has one of the worst deals in the industry
	- the program is not free, they are paying with equity at a steep price
	- I think as a part of the 6% equity given, coaching should be included
- we may need to do "FounderCon"
- techstars are consolidating back to Techstars city models and all programs will start and end at the same time. 
	- might be a good time to get in

2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	3. YES
		1. Therapy for years now, and coaching now but have done it before. 
			1. Therapy: she has kaiser has to give you a referral (it is so painful), they give you a list, she would call most (most go to voicemail), picked a few thinking she can vibe with them based on their voice. Super painful. Have had same therapist for 4yrs
			2. Coaching: usually referral, met some at engineering conferences for engineering leaders. They speak about efficiency in teams, etc. at these conferences. 
				1. While at YC, she met someone but doesn‚Äôt remember how she met her. Probably a referral. 
	4. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
	5. How long did you receive support?
	6. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. A lot of what I needed was emotional support, and got a lot of this from therapy and a women founders group. For this coaching was not as effective as compared to venting to someone or doing yoga/meditation. 
		2. Systematically talking through the problems and working towards a solution. 
	7. What did you wish was better?
		1. Talking to a coach that has founder experience is really helpful, teh same way how she now thinks a coach that has engineering leadership experience is helpful. I like more direct form of coaching like ‚Äúhere try this‚Äù. 
		2. She was part of group coaching as a founder, and found it helpful when people showed up. Nice way to make it cheaper and hear from others similar struggles. 
		3. Having done therapy and not familiar with coaching, it wasn‚Äôt super clear to me about how it would be helpful. 
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù,

- She would not have used our service to find quality coaches when she was looking recommendations/referrals. She would ask her network first,

2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:

		1. life coach: helped with more personal issue. As a coach, she has received coaching as a part of it. She was coached by one of the directors in front of other coaches, decided this was her test. After this she realized you must find somebody, particularly founders they need to find someone who can coach leaders. It is really important to have someone on that level.

### Notes:
- she is a coach herself, mentors young women early in their careers
- if it is not trauma, I think life and exec coaching are great.
- she doesn't like how the coaching space is getting commodified. 
	- for her, referrals have always worked. BetterUp for example, I'm not quite sure how their process works but by commodifying it I mean what is the standard/barrier to entry on the side of coaches who want to help. 
	- everyone who becomes tired of their career wants to become a life coach
- regarding our idea: that is really interesting. It may be the last frontier of support for founders.
	- I've seen the speed of technology means founders are under more pressure to keep up and there are no new breakthrough ideas there is only 1.1, 1.2 etc.
	- she was one of the top rated coaches for founders
		- time is of the essence and respects that for her founders
- there is only one VC firm she can think of that gives their founders coaches
- She has done this growth accelerator for about a year
	- VCs only want to invest, they don't want to spend any other money than this.
- She's pitched VCs and it has fallen on deaf ears. "They look like we are speaking Greek to them"
	- the way she pitched them "special program where any founder can join. They would make a cohort, help them find what they are stuck on etc.""
		- "We don't have a budget for it"
- **We should come to her event next April, ask more about this
	- invite people who want to form ecosystem of founders/funders/LPs etc. and have deep conversations about what is the problem with venture capital ecosystem.
		- whole problem was set up by white rich guys early on. 
		- then brown boys fund brown boys like them
		- women do the same thing but there are less

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
	1. YES
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		2. he is getting it through his school, "Abroad" is the coaching group
		3. he is part of fellowship program in school, they pay for coaching to develop fellows. 
		4. They gave him a few people they thought were good matches, he had "vibe check" calls with 3-4 people then picked one with startup experience
	2. How long did you receive support?
		1. 1hr/mo
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. For student founders, he doesn't have real world experience working with people. Also building a startup while in school is a challenge. Working with people the same age but he has to manage them
			1. mostly how to work with people, deal with conflicts
			2. more specific stuff about how to fundraise.
	4. What did you wish was better?
		1. he would appreciate if there were more specific themes for each call. For me it is not a priority of mine to think of what I need help with, I need to focus on operating.
			1. A lot of time, I don't even know what questions to ask to solve the problems. If I did, I wouldn't have the problem. 
			2. ask general check in questions to see if anything is degrading and needing attention.
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù, 
	1. Why haven‚Äôt you received coaching/therapy before?
	2. What would you need to be true to give it a try?
4. Do you know anyone who would be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach)?


### Notes:
- use "jobs to be done" framework to in depth user discovery calls that are demographic agnostic
- something he struggles with is realizing sleep/exercise are ESSENTIAL for him otherwise he is less effective. 
- target founders who are NOT currently in the program accelerator where they are getting free mentors/advice. 
- he will intro people to his network if I need it.

### Background:
- 

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. Yes
		1. therapy on and off since college. Executive coach chosen when starting Revel, proactively since they thought it would be helpful. Used them 6-9mo individually, ultimately decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it. This coach wasn‚Äôt providing the value they wanted, they needed a better fit. 
	2. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		1. Referred to her through her cofounder. They tried to work with another coach who was awesome, but he had a conflict of interest with another team of people building a similar product. 
		2. Tried two coaches, and went with the second. Had questions about if she would be a good fit when they started, but wanted to check this off their list quickly and made a less than optimal decision. 
	3. How long did you receive support?
		1. 6-9months 
	4. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. They thought it would be beneficial for the company, and they were friends before starting a company and didn‚Äôt want to mess up their friendship. They wanted to ensure they were working on themselves and their relationship as they grew the company.
		2. It made them more accountable to each other as founders. And did one or two sessions together as founders.
		3. They both know the areas they needed to improve and wanted to work on it with someone.
	5. What did you wish was better?
		1. Given that they selected someone that wasn‚Äôt perfect for them, having an idea of how to select someone that would be a good match would be great. 
		2. Just finding an executive coach is very difficult. People start by asking for a reference and often their friends don‚Äôt have any or good recommendations. 
		3. How to pay for it would be good to improve. Do you pay with cash, equity, VC money, etc.? 
			1. They used their business cash to pay for it. Later on, she paid with half cash half equity. 
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù, 
	1. Why haven‚Äôt you received coaching/therapy before?
	2. What would you need to be true to give it a try?
4. Would you be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach for yourself)?
### Notes:
-  Applying to jobs, Revel shut down after 4yrs
	- Downturn in the market accelerated it
- She would have used our service IF the quality of coach candidates was high enough. 
- Features she would like
	- I don‚Äôt necessarily know what I‚Äôd be looking for in terms of coaches. It would be nicer if based on what we know about her, we suggest to her what we think she needs.
	- How much you are willing to pay is a good filter
- She wants to beta test the onboarding once we have something ready. 
- [x] ask which coach she used AND the awesome one that had a conflict of interest, üìÖ 2023-10-20 ‚úÖ 2023-10-20
*************************************************************************************************************## [[24-Oct-2023]]

	- She wants to start with $250/hr but possibly start lower
- when hearing the 20% commission, it sounds fine to her
	- what she cares about most right now is being matched with founders that she can make an impact on AND practice the skills she's learning. 
- she is currently open to more types of founders to get more experience since she is new

	- deeper understanding of self, the why behind his actions 
	- setting his foundation as person
- what he was looking for

	- "the shack"
	- "AI grant" is the new YC which has focus on founders being alive as a person
		- reach out to companies within it 
- he could see VCs recommending this type of stuff to founders.

**## 18-Oct-2023
### Background:
- MIT recent grad (not a founder)

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. YES, 
		1. therapy and is currently receiving it weekly. 
		2. He has received professional coaching that was offered through his company until it wasn‚Äôt then he stopped.
	2.  How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
			1. Finding a therapist, he is still considering changing his therapist. Most often therapist changed because of changes in his insurance plan. In grad school, was assigned a therapist but there was limitations of what they could do so found someone off campus. His therapist now is through betterhelp. 
				1. This is the second or third person from betterhelp, it has been hard to find resources, either availability AND trying to find someone in network. Out of pocket cost is $45/week for 50min. 
				2. He also used ‚Äútalkspace‚Äù in the past for offline therapy. 
					1. In addition to seeing a therapist in-person. Needed help while traveling outside of the US as his home is in Brazil.
			2. ABinBev previously had coaching they paid for but they stopped paying for it (BetterUp). Fully paid for and he could use it even a couple times per week. Too much to keep paying for himself
				1. He doesn‚Äôt remember how he found the coach, but he liked the first one he was assigned. 
	3. How long did you receive support?
	4. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. He wanted support in better organizing himself and how to better navigate tough situations at work (stakeholder dynamics as he works in a large organization)
		2. It was nice to have someone to keep him accountable, hold him to routines and stay consistent.
		3. He was getting overwhelmed, and the coach helped him have clarity on what he should be doing and make hard decisions like how to say ‚Äúno‚Äù more often. 
	5. What did you wish was better?
		1. The matching process is a big pain point, at least for BetterHelp which he thought was supposed to be the most robust service out there, he was surprised how hard it was to find a good fit therapist.
			1. This was the biggest pain point
			2. He liked they offered a chat to help provide guidance outside of calls, he thinks this is the best type of service, hybrid chat/calls. His current coach is not good at the chat support (generic/not helpful). 
		2. He would ideally like to have a therapist in person and talk to via chat in between sessions, but adding in time to commute makes this tough. He now prefers virtual guidance to save him time. 
		3. He feels like his current approach is not ideal for him. She is good, but he wonders if there is someone out there that is better for him.
			1. He knows there are better APPROACHES that work for him.
		4. Matching based on shared values (e.g. religious preference) would be helpful. 
4. Would you be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach for yourself)?
	1. Keep him up-to-date
	2. He is actively looking to match with a new therapist

	1. YES
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		2. It correlates to what my startup is, he helps people undergoing infertility treatment
			1. time consuming, awful experience
			2. His wife sourced the therapist, he went with her
	2. How long did you receive support?
		1. He did individual and couples sessions
		2. 1.5yrs 
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. having an outlet to talk through things to ensure it wasn't bottled up, that turn into compounding problems.
		2. talking through things allows you to deal/cope with it, and they provide you tools/resources to think about things in a different way/accept. 
	4. What did you wish was better?
		1. Scheduling of appointments (small clinic, independent provider), if you needed more immediate assistance she didn't have options (before pandemic/telehealth). Had to drive 30min one way

### Notes:
- people ask how he copes/deals with things as a founder. Nothing in the startup life is going to be as hard as the infertility treatment/early father. 
- He knew what he was looking for but thinks this is 
- his class is having a conversation around this specific thing
	- "mentor magic" where you speed date with mentors which is tough. talk to 30-70 mentors in a week (can save them a week), reach out to a program admin about this
		- if there were ways to speed that up that would be awesome
		- [x] email him what I'm looking for, he'll share with his class, üìÖ 2023-10-23 ‚úÖ 2023-10-24

- he has considered therapy since then, but haven't felt that the need has been acute enough to invest. He still has support inthe AA community
	- on executive coaching side, but he doesn't think his income/career trajectory warrants coaching
		- He's sure that it is expensive, and it has a reputational problem from loose accreditation. 
		- He's spoken with VP/C-suite folks who offhand mention they work with exec coaches which made his ears perk up. 
- $200-$500 price range makes sense to him
- he thinks it makes sense for later stages, maybe Series A
- FSA option is interesting, equity probably not an option. 
- he's going through Techstars, and they are good about founder mental health and wellbeing. 
- [x] (follow up) he can ask the program manager if she wants to chat with me, üìÖ 2023-10-30 ‚úÖ 2023-10-29

*************************************************************************************************************## 11-Oct-2023

Talk therapy, did speak to an executive coach a year ago and she was offering private 1:1 AND group coaching. She was more interested in this with other female founders. ASk for contact. She did therapy for a year, stopped earlier this year. She had to interview multiple people on her own at first. Took her a long time to get over threshold to say "OKAY i'm actually going to do this and try therapy." 
- She reached out to friends in psychology and asked for their lists of recommendations. From that list she found someone she liked. 
- The friend didn't have to ask too many questions since she was a very close friend. 
	- Criteria: woman of color, someone who can understand south asian experience, she also didn't know if she needed a therapist vs executive coach. Wanted to talk about anxiety/stress of being a founder. 
	- Had a therapist that worked with other founders. Her friend did this for many of her friends in her circle and said "there is something here in terms of. She will intro me to her psychologist friend that wants this idea to win. 
	- 
NOTES: 
Her questions. do you have plans of incorporating behavior profile/generative AI to help with intake? YES. If we can scale the intake (have clients say things once, then use that over and over). "there's a lot of legs here". Schedule follow up call.  
  
## [[19-Oct-2023]] 
- She is in teh process of shutting down GlobalBelly  
- she graduated from her therapist, and really appreciated d her therapist saying she doesn't NEED it any more.  
- we have a strong application. Since we are pre-MVP, what will stand out is HOW WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THINGS? How aware are you of your strengths/weaknesses. They love things you can sell to other YC companies  
- number of startups that fail due to cofounder relationship issues "PUT THIS FRONT AND CENTER"  
- [x] Follow up with Madhuri, intro me to Natalie, üìÖ 2023-10-24 ‚úÖ 2023-10-24
	- exec coaching seminars for team building. Knows trends from enterprise point of view.  
- commercialization is a big issue for early founders who haven't launched a product before. Having someone on our board/advisors that have grown or sold something is very great.  
- Benefits of getting into YC or not, is getting great feedback. The process of prepping for interview/going through questions and poking holes in everything train us so well that we can go out and fundraise easier after .  
- getting feedback from YC/investors, they throw tech bro jargon into the email. It is helpful to learn this language and ask other founders what it means.

### Background:
- Founder

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
	1. YES
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		2. Have had three therapy experiences, two before being a foiunder
			1. one was for an eating disorder and was found through Kaiser, so she was assigned a team of professionals. This was a pretty good experience.
			2. In college, tried to find therapist to prevent relapse and it was difficult since LA has a shortage of therapists. First appt was 3mo out, and then they cancelled the appt. Then went through BetterHelp because of the ads, it was expensive for a college student, so she just did the messaging but felt she could do this through Omegle. 
			3. Since  being a founder, it was COVID and a few years out from college and big transition time, went through Kaiser and went through a matchmaking person who didn't seem to understand what I needed even though I said "I have crippling anxiety related to finding direction in life"
				1. it is a hassle to find someone new, so I didn't shop around for a therapist. Sometimes. 
	2. How long did you receive support?
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. She had a lot of time on her hands all of a sudden (in COVID and company wasn't in a super stressful stage), do I spend more time building a community or on my company. It helped me find out what my values are, and during COVID there was an anxiety of death/dying and losing family. 
		2. Also teasing out smaller stressors 
	4. What did you wish was better?
		1. 
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù, 
	1. Why haven‚Äôt you received coaching/therapy before?
	2. What would you need to be true to give it a try?
4. Would you be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach for yourself)?


### Notes:

- friend who had career coaching since leaving company is now doing therapy
	- he has a friend who does therapist matchmaking
- she really liked her first therapist who happened to use CBT, so she has pursued this since. 
- she had experience with her investor's partner but the expectations weren't set out early on. 
- let her know
	- she'd be down to try career coaching when it's ready!!!

### Notes:
- He's fully on board with this. This is one of the reasons he had to step away from a previous company. He was called upon as the moral float
- mental space would have been made (shift from drinking to fixing)
	- funding wise, they were generating potential revenue
- he has a few friends in mind 

*************************************************************************************************************This season there's some level of depression

I think that would be good but I'm nervous on cost. 

If you think it could be done like $400 a month including insurance or less.

For Pranab
- IFS a plus
- $400 a month or less unless we have insurance
- Desire is focus

**Negotiation and Compensation**
What's going on?
- I have a really high burn right now. 
- Thinking through that can be helpful

	- I would do better in a more structured environment

### Background:
- Founder

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
	1. Yes,
		1. Startup coach through techstars
		2. He's done therapy since 16, and ADHD coaching
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		1. He's explored coaches throughout his life. he knew he needed more mindset help as opposed to tactics. Finding him was through techstars discord as a "perk"
	2. How long did you receive support?
		1. Just started yesterday
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. he's expecting for the coach to be a sounding board with targeted end point, not just listening. Best coaches help you bring out your answers and to derive your own conclusions
		2. he was deviating from his original purpose/his why and got overdrawn into tactics.
	4. What did you wish was better?
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù, 
	1. Why haven‚Äôt you received coaching/therapy before?
	2. What would you need to be true to give it a try?
4. Do you know anyone who would be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach)?


### Notes:
- techstars new york is given a coach for each team.
- there is a discord of Techstars alumni which includes perks
	- this coach was a perk, 
	- two tiers of perks 
		- techstars universe (software etc listed online)
		- other perks in discord. 
- he has a coaching certificate but didn't think he was ready to start coaching other people
- the founder has to want to be coachable and he doesn't think many founders are like this
- "I'd rather have a coach than no coach, even if the coach was subpar. We are all stuck in our own shit, and having outside perspective from someone with no skin in the game to bring us back up to the 10000ft perspective is valuable"
- "none of us are as far along as we think we are"
	- a lot of intellectual masturbation with things like "jobs to be done"
- How techstars is trying to structure the coaching element, you get paired with 3 other founders, they have stoplight system (red, green personally). I don't find this useful at all. They talk to a managing director + associates. MD is great, the associates are often 20yr old taking a semester off from undergrad. They have no life experience. 
- he feels mentor madness is a waste of time (or at least inefficient), 3 weeks of preparation and two weeks of interviewing mentors. He thinks the mentors need to be vetted better
- techstars has one of the worst deals in the industry
	- the program is not free, they are paying with equity at a steep price
	- I think as a part of the 6% equity given, coaching should be included
- we may need to do "FounderCon"
- techstars are consolidating back to Techstars city models and all programs will start and end at the same time. 
	- might be a good time to get in 
- [ ]  reach out to his coach, üìÖ 2023-10-26 https://yoursecondcall.com/
 he will intro me to Gary Stewart üìÖ 2023-10-26

- the managing team needs some coaching as well.

### Background:
- Founder
- Found: The science-based path to personal growth, connection, and community.
	- Ask about this experience

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	3. YES
		1. Therapy for years now, and coaching now but have done it before. 
			1. Therapy: she has kaiser has to give you a referral (it is so painful), they give you a list, she would call most (most go to voicemail), picked a few thinking she can vibe with them based on their voice. Super painful. Have had same therapist for 4yrs
			2. Coaching: usually referral, met some at engineering conferences for engineering leaders. They speak about efficiency in teams, etc. at these conferences. 
				1. While at YC, she met someone but doesn‚Äôt remember how she met her. Probably a referral. 
	4. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
	5. How long did you receive support?
	6. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. A lot of what I needed was emotional support, and got a lot of this from therapy and a women founders group. For this coaching was not as effective as compared to venting to someone or doing yoga/meditation. 
		2. Systematically talking through the problems and working towards a solution. 
	7. What did you wish was better?
		1. Talking to a coach that has founder experience is really helpful, teh same way how she now thinks a coach that has engineering leadership experience is helpful. I like more direct form of coaching like ‚Äúhere try this‚Äù. 
		2. She was part of group coaching as a founder, and found it helpful when people showed up. Nice way to make it cheaper and hear from others similar struggles. 
		3. Having done therapy and not familiar with coaching, it wasn‚Äôt super clear to me about how it would be helpful. 
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù, 
	1. Why haven‚Äôt you received coaching/therapy before?
	2. What would you need to be true to give it a try?
4. Would you be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach for yourself)?

### Notes:
- She would not have used our service to find quality coaches when she was looking recommendations/referrals. She would ask her network first, 
- ‚ÄúFound‚Äù was a side project, and realized it is more of a services business NOT a software business. She made a book/program she wanted. Concepts from therapy to put together content. 
- [x] Follow up to download her book, üìÖ 2023-10-20 ‚úÖ 2023-10-24
- [x] Ask her the name of the coach she used, üìÖ 2023-10-20 ‚úÖ 2023-10-24

###  Questions:
1. Have you received professional guidance like life coaching, executive coaching, or therapy?
	1. Yes
		1. life coach 
		2. exec coach
		3. therapy
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		1. life coach: helped with more personal issue. As a coach, she has received coaching as a part of it. She was coached by one of the directors in front of other coaches, decided this was her test. After this she realized you must find somebody, particularly founders they need to find someone who can coach leaders. It is really important to have someone on that level. 
	2. How long did you receive support?
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. 
	4. What did you wish was better?
3. IF ‚Äúno‚Äù,

4. Do you know anyone who would be interested in trying out our service once it is ready for beta testing in November (either to provide feedback or find a coach)?


### Notes:
- she is a coach herself, mentors young women early in their careers
- if it is not trauma, I think life and exec coaching are great.
- she doesn't like how the coaching space is getting commodified. 
	- for her, referrals have always worked. BetterUp for example, I'm not quite sure how their process works but by commodifying it I mean what is the standard/barrier to entry on the side of coaches who want to help. 
	- everyone who becomes tired of their career wants to become a life coach
- regarding our idea: that is really interesting. It may be the last frontier of support for founders.
	- I've seen the speed of technology means founders are under more pressure to keep up and there are no new breakthrough ideas there is only 1.1, 1.2 etc.
	- she was one of the top rated coaches for founders
		- time is of the essence and respects that for her founders
- there is only one VC firm she can think of that gives their founders coaches
- She has done this growth accelerator for about a year
	- VCs only want to invest, they don't want to spend any other money than this.
- She's pitched VCs and it has fallen on deaf ears. "They look like we are speaking Greek to them"
	- the way she pitched them "special program where any founder can join. They would make a cohort, help them find what they are stuck on etc.""
		- "We don't have a budget for it"
- **We should come to her event next April, ask more about this
	- invite people who want to form ecosystem of founders/funders/LPs etc. and have deep conversations about what is the problem with venture capital ecosystem.
		- whole problem was set up by white rich guys early on. 
		- then brown boys fund brown boys like them
		- women do the same thing but there are less
	- A16Z disperses their funding and "you sink or swim"
- maybe approach "Venture Partners"
- she mentors at "The Alchemist"
- happy to intro me to MD of "The Alchemist"
	- Revi Milani
- https://www.alchemistaccelerator.com/
- she thinks what we are doing is very interesting
- Carla morten MMS norcal she can connect me
- [x] send follow up email to call her next week, üìÖ 2023-10-25 ‚úÖ 2023-10-25

	1. YES
2. IF ‚Äúyes‚Äù, tell me about that experience:
	1. How long did it take to find a professional, # of people tried before finding fit?
		2. he is getting it through his school, "Abroad" is the coaching group
		3. he is part of fellowship program in school, they pay for coaching to develop fellows. 
		4. They gave him a few people they thought were good matches, he had "vibe check" calls with 3-4 people then picked one with startup experience
	2. How long did you receive support?
		1. 1hr/mo
	3. What were the main benefits you received?
		1. For student founders, he doesn't have real world experience working with people. Also building a startup while in school is a challenge. Working with people the same age but he has to manage them
			1. mostly how to work with people, deal with conflicts
			2. more specific stuff about how to fundraise.
	4. What did you wish was better?
		1. he would appreciate if there were more specific themes for each call. For me it is not a priority of mine to think of what I need help with, I need to focus on operating.
			1. A lot of time, I don't even know what questions to ask to solve the problems. If I did, I wouldn't have the problem. 
			2. ask general check in questions to see if anything is degrading and needing attention.

### Notes:
- use "jobs to be done" framework to in depth user discovery calls that are demographic agnostic
- something he struggles with is realizing sleep/exercise are ESSENTIAL for him otherwise he is less effective. 
- target founders who are NOT currently in the program accelerator where they are getting free mentors/advice. 
- he will intro people to his network if I need it.
